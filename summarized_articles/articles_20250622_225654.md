# Trump's Peacemaker Legacy: A Reality Check

As President Donald Trump took office in January, he made a bold claim to be a peacemaker and unifier. He repeatedly pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours and bring peace to Gaza. However, five months into his presidency, reality has set in, and it's clear that Trump's approach to peacemaking has been unsuccessful.

The Russia-Ukraine war is now well into its third year with no peace deal in sight. Israel's military action in Gaza has only escalated, and the US could soon become directly involved in another conflict in the Middle East as Iran and Israel continue attacking each other.

During his presidential campaign, Trump presented himself as a pragmatist who would cut deals and bring peace to Gaza and Ukraine. He repeatedly pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, saying, "I'm not going to start a war; I'm going to stop wars." However, since taking office, it's become clear that peacemaking isn't as easy as Trump expected.

On Ukraine, there were hopes for a ceasefire in early March after the US successfully pressured Ukraine into agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire proposal. However, Russia only agreed to a partial ceasefire limited to strikes on energy infrastructure, which has been effectively ignored. The severity of Russia's assault has actually escalated in recent weeks.

On Gaza, Trump's peacemaking efforts appear to have had the opposite effect. Israel's military action has continued, and Operation Gideon's chariots has led to widespread international condemnation. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Israel's aim is to destroy everything that's left of Gaza.

Aside from failed peacemaking in Ukraine and Gaza, Trump has also bombed Yemen's Houthi rebels, launched air strikes on Somalia, and threatened to use military force to invade Greenland. This record is hardly surprising given Trump's focus on speedy peace deals during the campaign and the fact that wars have actually gotten worse since he took office.

So, why is Trump so bad at deals? There were at least three structural reasons. First, the Trump team's impatience. As promised during the campaign, Trump has tried to rush other parties into quick deals, hoping that US-set deadlines will force them into making necessary concessions. However, when these deadlines pass, the only thing that usually happens is that Trump loses interest.

Second, the Trump team's myopic focus on economic issues. Trump is always squarely focused on who's getting value for money in negotiations and often dangles the prospect of economic normalization as some sort of bargaining chip. Not only does this overlook the fact that many wars are fought over deeper issues that can't be resolved by cash, but it's also been exploited by negotiating parties.

Third, Trump's apparent affinity for strong men, including Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, which has encouraged them to do classic strongman things, even if they undermine peace negotiations. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump didn't want to get involved in Iran until he awoke to Fox News coverage of what it was portraying as Israel's military genius, whereupon he decided he needed to take some credit.

In conclusion, while Trump's record is hardly surprising given his focus on speedy peace deals during the campaign and the fact that wars have actually gotten worse since he took office, there were clearly structural reasons why his approach to peacemaking has been unsuccessful.

# The Rise and Fall of Finland's Populist Party

The populist Finn's party in Finland has been one of the most dominant political stories over the past decade. At its last parliamentary election in 2023, it came close second and secured its best ever result. However, since going into a coalition government with the National Coalition Party (NCP) two years ago, support for the Finn's party has massively declined.

The main reason behind this decline is austerity measures implemented by the government. Since taking office, the finance ministry, led by Finn's leader Raapura, has pushed ahead with an austerity regime aimed at cutting public spending by 4 billion euros by 2027. The cuts have primarily targeted healthcare services and social security, sparking backlash among voters.

The government has also pursued significant labor market reforms, including weakening employment rights and scrapping the tax deductibility of trade union membership fees. This has caused friction between the Finn's party and its support base, particularly among trade unions.

The Finn's party had been vague about where these cuts would fall and suggested that it wouldn't cut social security. However, this has not prevented voters from punishing the party in surveys and at the polling booth. At the European elections last year, the Finn's fell to sixth place, while at Finland's municipal elections in April this year, they received just 7.6% of the vote and lost more than half of their municipal seats.

The decline of the Finn's party is not unique. It has happened before when it joined a coalition government back in 2015, which subsequently introduced strict austerity measures and led to a dramatic collapse in support for the party. However, this time around, there are additional factors at play that have contributed to the party's decline.

One of these factors is the country's economic situation. Despite the government's stated aim of stabilizing public debt, growing the economy, and boosting employment, Finland's economy has not been doing well. The country's recovery from a dismal few years of economic stagnation and contraction through 2022 and 2023 is being dampened. Its debt ratio is still climbing despite a slower rate of borrowing, and unemployment is rising.

Another factor is the transition from being an anti-establishment opposition party to a party of government. This can be an awkward process that can reduce a party's appeal somewhat. The Finn's party has also been marred by a series of racism scandals that have kept it in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.

In contrast, the Finnish left and center have been enjoying a resurgence. The Social Democrats are leading the polls, while the Left Alliance is growing in support and has scored an impressive second place at last year's European elections.

The Finn's party's decline is a complex story with many factors at play. However, one thing is clear: its time in government has not gone well for the party.
