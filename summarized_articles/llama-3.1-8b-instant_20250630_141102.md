# Trump's Summit Wins Masked by Cringeworthy Diplomacy

In a bizarre display of subservience, NATO allies focused on appeasing Trump rather than addressing pressing issues. Initially, it seemed like a win for the US president, with NATO allies agreeing to boost defense spending by 5%.

However, upon closer inspection, the summit's priorities seemed to revolve around keeping Trump happy. The US delegation even convinced the hosts to truncate the main plenary session, reportedly at their request.

**Diplomatic Cringe: US Envoy's Text Messages**
The US envoy to NATO, Mark Rutter, sent congratulatory text messages to Trump, praising him for bombing Iran and claiming that no American president could have achieved the same level of defense spending commitment from European countries.

**The Infamous "Daddy" Comment**
Trump was also heard commenting that some countries' leaders "need their dads to protect them" â€“ a remark that sparked widespread disgust. This unbecoming display of behavior raises serious questions about the US president's fitness for office.

The focus on currying favor with Trump has undermined the legitimacy and effectiveness of the NATO summit. Will this trend continue, or will the alliance prioritize meaningful cooperation over appeasing the US president? The world waits with bated breath.

# The EU's Defense Strategy: A Shift Away from NATO?

### EU Expands Defense Deals with Non-European Countries

The European Union (EU) is expanding its defense partnerships with non-European countries, including Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the UK. This comes as a response to the EU's need to increase its independence from NATO, due to the uncertain commitment of US President Donald Trump to the alliance.

Trump's presidency has left European leaders worried about the future of NATO, especially given his conditionality of the US's commitment to Article 5, the mutual defense clause of the treaty.

### EU's History with NATO

The EU's defense policy has long been integrated into the transatlantic security framework of NATO. The EU's common foreign and security policy, as established in the 1992 master treaty, aimed to create a common defense policy, which might eventually lead to a common defense.

However, the integration of the EU's defense policy into NATO has prevented the EU from establishing more efficient internal structures for pooling and sharing military resources, buying arms, and operational coordination.

### Recent Developments

The EU has recently signed defense deals with several countries, including Moldova, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Albania, and North Macedonia. Talks are also underway with Australia and the Philippines.

These defense packs give the EU more options for procurement in the event of a conflict and allow the EU to increase its independence from NATO.

### Why is the EU Expanding its Defense Partnerships?

The EU is pursuing these deals due to several reasons:

*   Trump's erratic foreign policy and hostile attitude towards NATO have raised concerns about the US's commitment to the alliance.
*   Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has brought the military threat right to Europe's doorstep, and the EU wants to be able to rely on itself rather than the US's commitment to Article 5.
*   Broader geopolitical shifts, including new hybrid warfare tactics, have made the EU realize the need to increase its defense capabilities and expand its partnerships.
