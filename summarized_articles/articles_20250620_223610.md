# A Nuclear Consortium: Can It Provide a Way Out of the Escalating Conflict between Israel and Iran?

For months, tensions have been rising between Israel and Iran. The latest development in this crisis is the Trump administration's offer to Iran of a new nuclear deal. According to a high-ranking official, the deal might center around the idea of a nuclear consortium, an unorthodox proposal that would see Iranian, Arab, and even American companies cooperate on uranium enrichment.

Uranium enrichment is a process that increases the proportion of the isotope uranium 235 in natural uranium. The most common method of enrichment is via centrifuges, which convert uranium into a gas and then spin it at high speeds. For nuclear energy generation, uranium only needs to be enriched to the point where U235 accounts for about 3 to 5% of the total.

Iran's breakout time is essentially dependent on two things: how much uranium they've already enriched and how many centrifuges they have. The more centrifuges, the faster they can enrich. However, having a usable nuclear weapon requires Iran to develop a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.

The idea of a nuclear consortium has been floated by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witoff, and would see Iranian, Arab, and American companies cooperate on uranium enrichment. This could provide a way out of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. The proposal seems to be centered around two main elements: spreading the process of producing nuclear fuel across multiple countries in the region and investment by the US and Iran's Arab neighbors in Iran's nuclear industry.

There are several sticking points, including Saudi Arabia wanting an independent nuclear industry and it being unclear what happens to Iran's secretive underground enrichment plants or the uranium they've already enriched. Nonetheless, if all the relevant players decide that this is better than a full-on war in the Middle East, it might work.

The concept of a nuclear consortium is complex and ever-changing. Learning more about it can help us understand the world around us.

# The Unpopularity of the Czech Government: Causes and Consequences

The Czech government has been facing an unprecedented crisis in recent weeks. The justice minister's acceptance of a $45 million Bitcoin gift from an ex-convict sparked no confidence vote led by the populist opposition party ANO, which narrowly survived but deepened public distrust. As elections approach, it seems inevitable that the government will face a big defeat.

Czech politics is currently dominated by two major forces: the center-right coalition Spolu and the populist movement ANO, led by former prime minister Andre Babish. In 2021, ANO lost the election to the newly formed Spolu coalition, which entered government with three other parties. However, almost immediately, things started to go downhill.

The government faced a series of challenges, including Europe's energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, public finance issues due to the introduction of tax breaks, and communication failures. The government approved a pay rise for politicians in October 2022, which was perceived as tone-deaf given the worsening housing crisis and decline in living standards.

Public distrust in government is not new in Czechia, with the country consistently ranking among the lowest in the OECD for trust in national institutions. In fact, lawmakers are the least trusted institution, with confidence levels hovering around 20-30%.

In March, the justice ministry quietly accepted a large number of bitcoins worth $45 million from Tamas Uricovski, a convicted criminal who once ran an illegal darknet market. The scandal has not gone down well with the Czech public, and critics argue that accepting the donation risks legitimizing or laundering illegal profits and suggests bribery.

The government's handling of the scandal led to a no-confidence vote, which failed but caused damage. All parties in the current center-right government have ruled out working with ANO, making it likely that Babish will team up with the hard-right euroskeptic SPD party if he wins the next election.
