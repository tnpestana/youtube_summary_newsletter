# Trump's Peacemaker Legacy: Broken Promises and Escalating Conflicts

Throughout his 2024 US presidential campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to bring peace to Ukraine, end the war in Gaza, and pull the US back from foreign conflicts around the globe. In his inaugural address, he claimed that his proudest legacy would be that of a peacemaker and unifier. However, five months into his presidency, the Russia-Ukraine war is well into its third year with no peace deal in sight. Israel's military action in Gaza has only escalated, and it seems that the US may soon become directly involved in another conflict in the Middle East.

As the campaign unfolded, Trump repeatedly pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours and claimed that he would settle the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine before even arriving at the Oval Office. He also promised to pull the US back from its involvement in foreign conflicts under his America First foreign policy.

Trump's peacemaker stance was popular both with supporters of his isolationist foreign policy and with younger voters who were more likely to oppose the US's role in supporting Israel militarily. His pledge to pull the US back from foreign conflict also played well with Americans who were tired of decades of military interventions abroad, which have led to the deaths of thousands of US service members.

However, since taking office, it has become clear that peacemaking isn't as easy as Trump expected. On Ukraine, there were some hopes for a ceasefire in early March after the US successfully pressured Ukraine into agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire proposal along the front lines. However, Russia only agreed to a partial ceasefire limited to strikes on energy infrastructure, which it has effectively ignored anyway.

On Gaza, Trump's peacemaking efforts appear to have had the opposite effect. Not only has Israel's military action continued, but in recent months, it has escalated further with the ongoing Operation Gideon's chariots, leading to widespread international condemnation.

Trump's presidency appears to have emboldened Netanyahu, who appears confident that he can continue his attacks on Gaza, the West Bank, and now Iran, too, with US backing. Aside from failed peacemaking in Ukraine and Gaza, Trump has also bombed Yemen's Houthi rebels, launched air strikes on Somalia, and threatened to use military force to invade Greenland.

Three structural reasons contribute to Trump's failures as a peacemaker: his impatience, myopic focus on economic issues, and affinity for strong men. His impatience leads him to rush other parties into quick deals, hoping that US-set deadlines will force them into making necessary concessions. However, when these deadlines pass, the only thing that usually happens is that Trump loses interest.

His myopic focus on economic issues overlooks the fact that in many of these wars, the parties are fighting over deeper issues that can't be resolved by cash. This has been exploited by negotiating parties, with Zalinski massively overstating the value of Ukraine's rare earth deposits and Russian negotiators overestimating the losses suffered by American businesses who left Russia.

Finally, Trump's affinity for strong men encourages them to do classic strongman things, even if they undermine peace negotiations. The New York Times reported that Trump didn't want to get involved in Iran until he awoke to Fox News coverage of what it was portraying as Israel's military genius, whereupon he decided he needed to take some credit.

In conclusion, Trump's record so far is pretty terrible, and there were clearly structural reasons to be pessimistic about the future. None of this is in defense of Biden, who was also pretty rubbish at negotiating peace deals. Nonetheless, it is a fair criticism given Trump's focus on speedy peace deals during the campaign and the fact that wars have actually gotten worse since he took office.

# The Rise and Fall of Finland's Populist Party: An Analysis

Finland has been grappling with the rise of populist hard or far-right parties in recent years. One such party, the Finn's party, gained significant traction at its last parliamentary election in 2023, securing its best-ever result. However, since joining a coalition government, the party has suffered a massive decline in popularity and heavy losses in local elections.

The party's descent from power can be attributed to various factors. One major contributor is austerity measures implemented by the government. The Finn's party leader, Raapura, as finance minister, pushed for significant spending cuts, amounting to â‚¬4 billion by 2027. The government's approach was criticized for its lack of empathy and off-putting tone.

Moreover, the party's base of support has been eroded due to labor market reforms, which have weakened employment rights and scrapped tax deductibility for trade union membership fees. This move has caused friction between the Finn's party and trade union elements of its support base.

The party's own evolution from a working-class party without socialism to an increasingly anti-immigration, nationalist, and fiscally conservative force has also contributed to its decline. The 2023 pre-election economic program was fiscally conservative, calling for spending cuts and balance in state finances.

Despite the government's stated goals of stabilizing public debt, growing the economy, and boosting employment, Finland's economy is not in a good place. The country's recovery from stagnation and contraction has been dampened, with rising debt ratios and unemployment figures.

The transition from opposition to governing party can be challenging for any party, which may have reduced the Finn's party appeal. Meanwhile, the left and center parties have gained momentum, with the Social Democrats leading polls and winning municipal and county elections.

This complex topic is ever-changing, but it's crucial to understand the world around us.
